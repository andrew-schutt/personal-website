        <p>Welcome to the 'About Me' page.  Remember if you have any questions feel free to contact me using my email schutt(dot)andrew(at)gmail(dot)com</p>
        <p>As my home page stated I am a University of Northern Iowa graduate and graduated with a degree in Computer Science.
            Throughout my time in school I held a job performing tech support and basic sys admin work for multiple departments under the University Vice President office at UNI.</p>
        <p>Since then I have have worked primarily in development role either as a programmer or automation developer</p>
        <p>Outside of work I enjoy many different hobbies.  Fiddling with computers and generally
            fixing/breaking computers/software/consoles is a past time of mine.
            I have always loved the game of soccer and have been playing since I was a little toddler running around following
            my older brother.  The best team is Chelsea FC.
            Listening and sifting through music is something I greatly enjoy as well.  I recently recieved a record player as present and have begun to build out a respectable record collection.</p>
        <p>Another hobby of mine is simply sitting down and writing scripts and various, essentially, meaningless programs to complete trivial and especially repetitive tasks.
            Being presented with a problem and finding a solution is why I enjoy programming.  Lately I have been on a big Javascript kick.</p>
        <p>My other hobby and passion is reading.  For leisure I wrill
            read books, novels,  magazines, newspapers, online articles, Wikipedia, and, well, essentially anything that I can get my hands (or finger-tips for that matter) on.
